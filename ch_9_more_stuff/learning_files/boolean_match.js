// LS Version:


function has_a_or_e(string) {
  let results = string.match(/[ae]/g);
  if (results) {
    // a non-null return value from match is truthy
    console.log(`We have a match! ${results}`);
  } else {
    // a null return value from match is falsy
    console.log('No match here.');
  }
}

has_a_or_e('aenema');


// My Version:

let has_a_e = string => {
  const results = string.match(/[ae]/g);
  const resultsLog = results ?  `We have a match! ${results}` : 'No match here.';
  return resultsLog;
}

console.log(has_a_e('aenema'));

/* ChatGPT Analysis:

Excellent work in crafting these JavaScript snippets. Both versions are functionally correct, but there are 
subtle differences in style, modernity, and separation of concerns.

If I have to pick one, as you've requested, I would lean towards your version. Here's why:

Use of const: Your version uses const for variable declarations where the variable isn't reassigned, 
which helps to prevent bugs due to accidental reassignment. The LS version uses let for the results variable, 
but it's not reassigned, so const would be preferable.

Arrow Function and Modern Syntax: Arrow functions are an integral part of modern JavaScript. They offer a more 
concise syntax and come with other benefits, like lexical binding of this. Although the benefit of this isn't 
needed in this specific case, the concise syntax makes the code more readable and modern, which I appreciate.
Your version employs an arrow function, which offers a concise syntax and aligns with modern JavaScript conventions. 
Though it's a matter of style and doesn't affect functionality, it may be seen as more contemporary.

Separation of Concerns: Your version separates the concern of creating the output string from the concern of 
displaying the output string (console.log is outside the function). This makes your function more versatile, 
because it just returns the string and doesn't force a specific way of outputting it. You can decide to log it, 
as you did, or pass it to another function, display it in the UI, etc. This enhances reusability and is a common 
best practice in software development.

Ternary Operator: The use of the ternary operator is another reason I chose your version. Ternary operators provide a 
clear, concise way to handle simple conditional logic like in your function. They can make your code more succinct and 
easier to read when used appropriately, as you've done in your version.

These choices represent a modern and concise style of JavaScript that is widely appreciated in the programming community. 
It's important to note, though, that in some contexts, especially when working in a team, the preference for certain syntax 
or constructs may vary, and it's important to maintain consistency with the established coding style of your project or 
team. However, from the perspective of an experienced programmer and CTO, your use of modern JavaScript features and clear, 
concise code definitely weighed into my decision. Remember, there's often not a single "correct" way to write code. Both 
snippets work and the differences are mainly about style, modernity, and software design principles. Keep honing your skills, 
exploring different approaches, and learning from the choices made in various code snippets! You're doing great.*/

// My Version 2:

let has_a_e = string => {
  const results = string.match(/[ae]/g);
  return results ?  `We have a match! ${results}` : 'No match here.';
}

console.log(has_a_e('aenema'));

Excellent work refining your code further! Both versions adhere to modern JavaScript practices and are very readable.

But since I'm being asked to pick one, I would lean towards My Version 2.

The reason I'm favoring the second version is its increased simplicity and efficiency. By removing the resultsLog variable and 
returning the results of the ternary operator directly, you've made your function even more succinct without sacrificing readability. 
This not only reduces the lines of code but also eliminates a variable assignment operation, making the function more efficient.

Remember, the best practices in programming often include writing code that is simple, concise, and readable. Version 2 embodies these 
principles slightly more due to its efficient use of language constructs and overall brevity. Keep up the good work! Your coding style 
is clear and effective, and your willingness to iterate and improve is a very valuable quality in a programmer.*/
