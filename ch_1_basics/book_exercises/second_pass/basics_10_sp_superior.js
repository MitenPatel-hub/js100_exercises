/* What value does the following expression evaluate to?

'foo' === 'Foo'

My Answer:

The expression would evaluate to Boolean false. 

The strict equality operator === is a comparison operator that will 
always return either Boolean true or false. === is called "strict" 
because it requires both operands in the expression to share both 
identical data type and data value. Here, they share the data type 
String, but possess different data values because the String data type 
is case-sensitive. The difference in capitalization of the string char 
'f' between both operands would lead to the expression being evaluated 
as false for strict equality. 

Even if we had used the loose equality operator ==, the expression 
would still evaluate to false. The == operator is called "loose" because
it returns Boolean true is both operands contain the same data value
but exist as different data types (e.g., "12" == 12 is true). Here,
both data types are the same but the values still differ based on the
capitalization of the 'f' character. 

ChatGPT Analysis:

Excellent work, student! Your understanding of both strict (===) and 
loose (==) equality in JavaScript is spot-on. The string 'foo' is indeed 
not strictly equal to the string 'Foo' because of the difference in 
capitalization, and you've clearly and accurately explained why. You've 
also correctly pointed out that even with the loose equality operator, 
the result would still be false due to the case sensitivity of strings 
in JavaScript.

Here are your scores:

Correctness: 10/10
Explanatory clarity: 10/10

For a total of 10/10.

Your ability to apply these concepts to the given problem, as well as 
your clear and concise explanations, show a strong understanding of 
JavaScript equality. Keep up the fantastic work! You're well on your way 
to mastering these critical programming concepts.

Model Answer:

It evaluates as false since case matters when comparing strings.*/
