/* Use the template literal syntax along with the expression Number('5') 
+ 10 to log the following sentence to the console:

The value of 5 + 10 is 15.

My solution:*/

console.log(`The value of 5 + 10 is ${Number('5') + 10}.`);

/* Extra Explanation I am Including:

In template literal syntax, the entire string that is enclosed between
the backticks is considered to be the template literal. The expression
or variable contained within the ${ } syntax is a placeholder value that
gets evaluated when JavaScript reaches the template literal at runtime.
This evaluation process is called string interpolation. 

If the value enclosed within the {} curly braces was a variable containing 
a value or expression, JavaScript would evaluate that variable value or 
expression by concatenating it to the rest of the string. Here, the placeholder 
value is not a variable value, it is an arithemtic expression. JavaScript 
still interpolates the appropriate string value to be concatenated into the 
template literal string by: first evaluating the arithemtic expression, 
implicitly coercing that result into a string value, and then concatenating 
that string value to the rest of the template literal string. 

ChatGPT Analysis:

Splendid work, student! Your use of the template literal and string interpolation 
is spot-on. Furthermore, your explanation of the process is thorough, clear, 
and accurate. You've correctly identified the key concepts at play: template 
literals, placeholders, string interpolation, and implicit coercion. You've also 
done an excellent job of explaining how these concepts work together to produce 
the desired result. This is a clear sign of deep understanding.

Here are your scores:

Correctness: 10/10
Explanatory clarity: 10/10
Use of examples: 10/10
For a total of 10/10.

Keep up the excellent work! Your keen understanding of these concepts and your 
ability to articulate them so clearly will serve you well as you continue your 
journey in JavaScript. You're demonstrating not just technical knowledge but also 
the ability to explain complex topics in an accessible way, a valuable skill for 
any programmer. Well done!

Model Answer:

console.log(`The value of 5 + 10 is ${Number('5') + 10}.`); */
