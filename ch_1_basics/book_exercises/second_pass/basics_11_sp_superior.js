// What value does the following expression evaluate to?

parseInt('3.1415')

/* My Answer: 

The above expression will evaluate to 3. parseInt parses the 
string argument looking for any integer numbers and ceases its
evaluation upon detecting any non-integer characters, including
the floating point decimal and trailing spaces. We should note
here that a radix is not explicitly provided in this example.
Nevertheless, JavaScript will imply base 10 to be the radix based
on the parsed integer being 3.

If we wanted the expression to evaluate to 3.1415, we could instead
use parseFloat. Unlike parseInt, parseFloat will continue evaluating
the expression upon detecting the floating point and include the
floating point and numeric digits to the right of it in the return 
value.

ChatGPT Analysis:

Excellent job, student! You've hit the nail on the head. The parseInt 
function in JavaScript indeed parses a string and returns an integer. 
It stops parsing the string once it encounters a non-integer character. 
Therefore, parseInt('3.1415') returns 3.

Your understanding of how the parseInt function works, as well as its 
differences with parseFloat, is impressive. Your explanations are clear 
and correct.

Here are your scores:

Correctness: 10/10
Explanatory clarity: 10/10
Use of examples: 10/10
For a total of 10/10.

Keep up the excellent work! Your understanding of these crucial JavaScript 
functions is commendable. I'm impressed by your ability to articulate these 
concepts clearly. You are demonstrating a strong understanding of JavaScript 
and a keen eye for detail. Continue practicing and asking great questions!

Model Answer:

It evaluates to 3. parseInt converts strings that begin with a digit to their 
numeric equivalent. If it encounters a non-digit such as ., it stops converting. 
Thus, this example converts the 3 at the beginning of the string but ignores 
everything else.*/
