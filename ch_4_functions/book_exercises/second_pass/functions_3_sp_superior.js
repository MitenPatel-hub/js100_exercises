/* ChatGPT Analysis Solution 4 vs. Model Solution: 

Solution 4 -

Oh, my, this is indeed an elegant little solution you've devised here, young 
scholar. Let me break down its virtues and where it could possibly improve. 

1. **Structure and Modular Design**: Bravo! Your code is well-structured and 
modular. Functions are clearly defined and are doing one thing, which makes 
them easy to understand and maintain. Grade: 9/10.

2. **Code Readability and Clarity**: Your code is clear and easy to read. The 
naming of your functions and variables are concise and descriptive. However, a 
bit of comments here and there explaining the purpose of your functions wouldn't 
hurt. Grade: 8/10.

3. **Functional Completeness**: The code does exactly what it's supposed to do: 
get inputs, perform a multiplication operation, and return the result in a neat 
string. Grade: 10/10.

**Overall Grade**: 9/10.

The only area that could use a bit of improvement is the inclusion of code comments. 
Although your code is quite readable, adding comments explaining the purpose of each 
function or significant sections of code would be beneficial. This makes it easier 
for others (or even yourself in the future) to understand your thought process and 
the purpose behind your code.

Improved version:

const rlSync = require('readline-sync');

// Function to perform multiplication operation
const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;

// Function to get a number from the user
const getNumber = prompt => parseFloat(rlSync.question(prompt));

// Main function to perform multiplication of two user inputs
const multiplyInputs = () => {
  const firstNumber = getNumber("Enter the first number:\n");
  const secondNumber = getNumber("Enter the second number:\n");
  // Return the equation as a string
  return `${firstNumber} * ${secondNumber} = ${multiply(firstNumber, secondNumber)}`;
}

// Log the result to the console
console.log(multiplyInputs());
```

Remember, in the realm of code, readability and clarity often trump cleverness. 
Keep up the good work!

Model Solution -

While embedding the require inside the function technically works, it is not a 
common or recommended practice. It may lead to unanticipated consequences like 
redundant loading and can potentially impact performance if the function is 
called repeatedly.

Structure and Modular Design: The require statement is misplaced inside the 
function getNumber. It should be at the top of the file. This makes the code 
less clean and less performant if the function is called multiple times. 
Grade: 7/10.

Code Readability and Clarity: Despite the misplacement of the require statement, 
the code is still quite readable and the intention is clear. However, the 
misplaced require statement might confuse other developers who expect it at the 
top of the file. Grade: 8/10.

Functional Completeness: The code performs the expected task, but it could be 
more efficient and safer with the require statement at the top and input 
validation. Grade: 9/10.

Overall Grade: 8/10. */
