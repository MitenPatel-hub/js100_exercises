/* Write a program named greeter.js that greets 'Victor' three times. 
Your program should use a variable and not hard code the string value 'Victor' in each greeting. 
Here's an example run of the program:

$ node greeter.js
Good Morning, Victor.
Good Afternoon, Victor.
Good Evening, Victor. 

I am not creating a separate file called greeter.js. The program is in this file.*/

let greeter = 'Victor';
console.log(`Good Morning, ${greeter}.`);
console.log(`Good Afternoon, ${greeter}.`);
console.log(`Good Evening, ${greeter}.`);
