// Take a look at this code snippet. What does this program log to the console? Why?

let foo = 'bar';
{
  let foo = 'qux';
}

console.log(foo);

/* My Answer:

The program will log 'bar' to the statement because let foo = 'bar' was declared in
the global scope and console.log(foo) was also declared in the global scope. Although
let foo = 'qux' was declared between let foo = 'bar' and console.log(foo), it was 
declared within a block with the let keyword. let variables declared within a block
have block-scope. The visibility of let foo = 'bar' to the program ends on line 4.

ChatGPT Analysis:

Your answer is correct and well-structured. You understood the nature of the let 
statement and block scope in JavaScript. It is accurate to point out that the foo 
variable inside the block doesn't overwrite the foo variable in the global scope 
due to the nature of block scope.

I would grade this a 9/10. It might be beneficial to add that the foo variable 
inside the block only shadows the foo variable in the global scope within that block, 
meaning it doesn't affect the foo variable outside of the block. This small note 
would complete the explanation.

Well done, keep up the good work!

Model Answer:

The program logs bar.

Line 1 initializes a variable named foo with the value 'bar'. Line 2 starts a block, 
which creates a new scope for let variables. The variable on line 1 is still visible 
at this point, but line 3 declares a new variable named foo that shadows (hides) the 
variable from line 1. This second variable gets initialized to 'qux', but it goes out 
of scope on line 4 when the block ends. That brings foo from line 1 back into scope, 
so line 6 logs its value: bar.

ChatGPT Analysis:

Both your answer and the model answer correctly identify that the program will log 
'bar' to the console and explain the concept of variable shadowing and block scope 
in JavaScript correctly.

The model answer is a bit more detailed in explaining exactly how variable shadowing 
works and mentions that the second 'foo' declaration hides the first one within its 
scope. This additional detail might help someone who isn't already familiar with how 
scopes work in JavaScript.

Nevertheless, your answer was accurate and concisely conveyed the main concepts. Both 
are excellent answers, but the model answer is a tad more thorough in its explanation. 
I would score the model answer a 10/10 and your answer a 9/10. Good job!
